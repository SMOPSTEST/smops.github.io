								<h2 class="major">The mission</h2>
								
								<p>Mars is an incredibly harsh environment: global-covering dust storms, toxic terrain, thin atmosphere, extremely low temperatures. To push the concept of <b>human exploration of the Red Planet</b>, much more research needs to be done on the adaptation of human physiology to such hard conditions. After 6 months of travel in microgravity condition, having dealt with the shock of a planetary reentry and landing, the first crew on Mars will face the challenge of recovery and rehabilitation, but also the need to assess and mitigate independently any possible health emergency throughout the mission. </p>
								<p>To enable these opportunities, we are organizing <b>SMOPS</b> (<b>S</b>pace <b>M</b>edicine <b>OP</b>eration<b>S</b>), an analogue mission that will take place at the MDRS (Mars Desert Research Station), a research facility owned and managed by The Mars Society in Utah, USA. For two weeks in isolation, our analogue astronauts will test different technologies and operational scenarios in the field of space medicine, in preparation for future human missions to Mars.</p>
								<p>The conditions offered by the MDRS are in many ways similar to the ones that can be found in a possible Mars habitat: desertic environment, crew isolation, spacesuit simulators for external activities, limited living spaces and resources (water and food), local energy (solar panels), and food production (greenhouse). This will allow analogue astronauts on Earth to simulate, as best as possible, the difficulties that human crews will face on the martian surface.</p>

	<p>Making sure that the crew is healthy and safe is of paramount importance for any research mission. In the case of an analog space mission this includes monitoring physical health, but also the mental states of the members of the crew, to ensure that they remain healthy in isolation. The SMOPS crew will perform a <b>daily kinesiology exercise routine</b>, measuring its impact on their health and wellbeing and how they cope with stress. Moreover, they will perform <b>cortisol tests</b>, playing an important role in understanding (but also preventing) potential health risks including high blood pressure, anxiety, high blood sugar, muscle weakness, etc..; the results of this experiment will be analyzed and published by one of the crew members who is a medical researcher at the University of Calgary, Canada. Another experiment will make use of <b>electroencephalography</b> to observe the changes in the crew members’ brains during meditation sessions. </p>

	<p>Space suit simulators are a necessary element of analogue space research, because they can increase the degree of fidelity of simulations and they pave the way for space suit technology development. In the frame of space suit and biomonitoring research, the SMOPS crew will test both the <b>BG space suit simulator prototype</b>, produced by Mars Planet, and a pair of <b>sensorised smart shoes</b>, engineered by Vibram and E-Novia group. Both experimental technologies will include several sensors able to measure the crew’s health conditions and the surrounding environment. Moreover, the health parameters of crew members will also be continuously monitored thanks to the <b>Astroskin biomonitor</b>. Such wearable biomonitors include integrated sensors designed to measure the body activity, heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.</p>

During the SMOPS missions, the crew will run different experiments aimed at the development of emerging technologies. For example, the <b>quality of air</b> will be monitored within the MDRS habitat, thanks to a <b>life support system</b> device developed by the italian company D-Orbit. Moreover, the <b>use of drones on Mars</b> will be investigated by the Drone Operations for Martian Environment (DOME) research group, performing mapping and station inspection flights with a VTOL (Vertical Take Off Landing) drone. Finally, as additive manufacturing paves the way for <i>in situ</i> resources utilisation, several <b>3D printed tools</b> will be tested and more will be printed directly at the station, thanks to an industrial-level printer provided by Roboze.</p>
